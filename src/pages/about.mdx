The Central Operations Platform (COP) turns traditional manual systems into accessible digital services.

It allows you to easily input information on a mobile-friendly platform. This data is easily accessible, helping better inform your work and that of your organisation.

COP aims to reduce Border Forceâ€™s dependence on old applications, particularly those based on Microsoft Excel and Access, capturing and sharing information consistently, quickly and more accurately.

Watch to find out more about how COP is transforming the way Border Force collects and shares data.
