<LargeTitle text={'Mandatory Declarations (Man Dec)'} />

The Mandatory Declarations (Man Dec) allows Border Force to identify potential conflicts of interest, which could make the organisation vulnerable to integrity threats.

All Border Force staff must complete the Man Dec.

It safeguards both you and the organisation and reinforces a culture of professionalism and integrity, which enhances UK border security.

**Around 85% of staff members have nothing to declare.**

With the Man Dec, you can declare:

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
	<li><strong>Sponsorship</strong> - if you have supported or intend to support any UK immigration or migration application.</li>
	<li><strong>Other employment</strong> – if you undertake any paid employment, unpaid employment, self-employment, voluntary work and/or directorship outside your official duties in Border Force</li>
	<li><strong>Criminality</strong> – if you have been arrested, convicted or cautioned for any criminal offence in or outside the UK</li>
	<li><strong>Personal Finance</strong> - if you have been declared bankrupt or insolvent, or have entered into an individual voluntary arrangement</li>
	<li><strong>Business interests</strong> - if you have business interests in Home Office contracts</li>
</ul>

A new declaration is required annually, if you’re a new joiner and if any of your circumstances have changed.
