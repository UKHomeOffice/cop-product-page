<LargeTitle text={'Roadmap'}/>

The COP roadmap shows what we want to achieve in the next 12 months.

The outcomes of the roadmap will not change during the year, though the actions we prioritise may alter as we go through the coming months.

<SmallTitle text={'Outcome 1'}/>

**Streamline:** Less time on paperwork to focus on more valuable work

We will analyse whether we’re meeting this outcome by looking at the:

<BulletList list={['Number of forms submitted','Number of services live on COP','Daily and monthly users']}/>

Some of the activities we're planning to undertake over the next 12 months include Declare Integrity Risks (Mandatory Declarations), Intel Referrals, Events at the Border, Intel Workflow service RefData and a task management solution for Operations and Intel.

<SmallTitle text={'Outcome 2'}/>

**Inform:** Accurate and timely data that enables evidence-based decisions

We will analyse whether we’re meeting this outcome by looking at the:

<BulletList list={['The time it takes to enter data','Analysts using the data', 'Number of interventions']}/>

Some of the activities we’re planning to undertake over the next 12 months include sGMR, building out Extract/Transform/Load tools for reporting, embedding PowerBI into COP for reporting, and meeting the needs of Analysts to use the data.

<SmallTitle text={'Outcome 3'}/>

**Trusted:** Our processes and technologies work when and where needed

We will analyse whether we’re meeting this outcome by looking at the:

<BulletList list={['Reliability/ resilience/ uptime', 'Number of legacy systems retired', 'Number of support tickets received']}/>

Some of the activities we're planning to undertake over the next 12 months include improving our end user documentation, improving support arrangements, adding to the collaboration tools and new ways of capturing data on smartphones.
