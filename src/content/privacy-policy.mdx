Provision of the Central Operations Platform is from Borders Systems and the DDaT directorate, both of which are part of the Home Office.The data controller for COP is Border Force – a data controller determines how and why personal data can be processed. You can request our Data Protection Impact Assessment and Data Management Policy from the COP team.

<MediumTitle text={'What data we need'}/>

The personal data we collect from you on COP may include:

<BulletList list={['your full name', 'your job role and team', 'your Adelphi number', 'your mandatory declaration', 'your security clearance levels and expiry date', 'your Internet Protocol (IP) address, and details of which version of web browser and device that you used']}/>

Information on how you use the site, using cookies and page tagging techniques:

<BulletList list={['the pages you visit on cop.homeoffice.gov.uk', 'how long you spend on each cop.homeoffice.gov.uk page', 'what you click on while you’re visiting the site', 'Poise ID', 'your Home Office email address', 'your mobile phone number', 'Pages that you view']}/>

All information added to the platform is linked to your unique user ID for audit purposes. Under the Data Protection Act 2018, we are processing this information on a performance-of-a-public-task basis to allow you to conduct your duties as a Border Force employee. We are also reliant on contractual processing of your data. We use cookies to do this and you cannot access the COP from a non-home office device.

<MediumTitle text={'Why we need it'}/>

We use this information to enable you to log in to the service that we provide and to link information you add into COP to your account. We use the information that you provide to help make sure that we can enforce access control and keep data secure.

We use information about your email and your name that we hold within the system when we send you a notification. We use the GOV.UK Notify service, to send you notifications from COP to your Home Office email address; this service is operated and assured by the Cabinet Office.

The legal basis for processing your personal data is for the performance of a public task and under contract.

We use a service called Matamo to collect information about how you use the COP. We do this to help make sure that the site is meeting the needs of its users and help us to make improvements to the site and service that we provide.

<MediumTitle text={'What we do with your data'}/>

The data we collect may be shared with supplier organisations, other government departments, agencies and public bodies, but only when there is an appropriate Border Force business need that will be facilitated by sharing this data. For example, we will share some information with Home Office Performance and Reporting Analytics Unit (PRAU) for MI Reporting.

We will not:

<BulletList list={['sell or rent your data to third parties', 'share your data with third parties for marketing purposes']}/>

We will share your data if we are required to do so by law – for example, by court order, or to prevent fraud or other crime.

<MediumTitle text={'How long we keep your data'}/>

We will only retain your personal data for as long as:

<BulletList list={['it is needed for the purposes set out in this document', 'the law requires us to']}/>

In general, this means that we will only hold your personal data for the time you are a member of Border Force and then a maximum of 5 years after you leave the Force.

<MediumTitle text={'Where your data is processed and stored'}/>

We design, build and run our systems to make sure that your data is as safe as possible at any stage, both while it’s processed and when it’s stored. We store your data within on an assured platform within the UK.

We use GOV.UK Notify, a service provided by Cabinet Office to send you notifications about the COP. Any information included in the notification email or SMS is stored in Notify for a maximum of 7 days; this is stored within the EEA.

<MediumTitle text={'How we protect your data and keep it secure'}/>

We are committed to doing all that we can to keep your data secure. We have set up systems and processes to prevent unauthorised access or disclosure of your data – for example, we protect your data using varying levels of encryption.

We also make sure that any third parties that we deal with keep all personal data they process on our behalf secure.

<MediumTitle text={'What are your rights?'}/>

You have the right to request:

<BulletList list={['information about how your personal data is processed', 'a copy of that personal data - this copy will be provided in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format', 'that anything inaccurate in your personal data is corrected immediately']}/>

You can also:

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>raise an objection about how your personal data is processed</li>
  <li>request that your personal data is erased if there is no longer a justification for it</li>
  <li>ask that the processing of your personal data is restricted in certain circumstances</li>
  <li>If you have any of these requests, get in contact with the COP team, by raising a support request at the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://support.cop.homeoffice.gov.uk/servicedesk/customer/portal/3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Service Desk</a></li>
