<MediumTitle text={'Get data in and out easily'}/>

COP helps you log information — whether it be forms, reports, images or biometrics — on laptops and mobile devices. It translates the information into data that you can track, analyse and share to help Border Force make better decisions.

The services currently on COP include:

<BulletList list={['Immediate Event Notification (IEN)', 'National Security (NS) Referral', 'Cash Detection', 'Operational Activity Reporting (OAR)', 'Mandatory Declarations', 'Use of Force']}/>
