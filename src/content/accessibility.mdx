We want everyone to be able to get and do what they need with this service, regardless of access needs, due to a disability or condition.

<p class="govuk-body">This accessibility statement contains information about the Central Operations Platform, available at <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.cop.homeoffice.gov.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://www.cop.homeoffice.gov.uk (opens in new tab).</a></p>

This website is run by Border Force. We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you should be able to:

<BulletList list={['Zoom in up to 300%, without the text spilling off the screen.', 'Navigate most of the website using just a keyboard.', 'Reach the main dashboard from every form on COP.', 'Read and navigate the order on COP as it is logical and intuitive/clear.', 'Tab through questions in the form whilst always having the focus visible.']} />

We’ve also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.

<p><a class="govuk-link" href="https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> Abilitynet (opens in new tab)</a> has advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability.</p>

<LargeTitle text={'How accessible this website is'} />

We aim to meet international accessibility guidelines. However, this may not always be possible, or we may have missed a problem.

Some people may find parts of this service difficult to use because:

<BulletList list={['Drop down lists may require users to “type to search” for their options as not all options will be displayed initially.', 'Adding additional instances of a response, such as a second passport number/adding a new staff grade in Operational Activity Reporting (OAR), may make the form tab to the top of the page for keyboard only users.', 'The JAWS screen reader is not compatible with the Edge Chromium browser, which is the Home Office standard.', 'Skip to content does not highlight the body of text that it skips to.', 'Questions on the form and some labels in names, such as the forms page, are unable to be identified by the screen reader. The NVDA screen reader is able to read text fields, tabs, links and radio buttons.', 'Fields are only auto completed from information in the user’s profile on COP and not from their browser.', 'Headings and titles on COP forms and pages do not get read out by the screen reader.', 'The main headings on each page are h2 and not h1.', 'Images on COP product pages do not have a text description of the image.', 'There are some images of text.', 'Videos in the Help pages about Mandatory Declarations and COP reports do not contain sound, video descriptions or captions.']} />
