COP supports the mobile workforce, allowing officers to enter data digitally on the go. The benefits include:

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li><span class="govuk-!-font-weight-bold">A quicker and easier online system to use.</span> It means you spend less time inputting information, such as filling in forms and reports, and more time focussing on your day job.</li>
  <li><span class="govuk-!-font-weight-bold">A secure, centralised platform that is easily accessible.</span> Integrate the data into other systems, reduce duplication and unnecessary work.</li>
  <li><span class="govuk-!-font-weight-bold">Improved data quality, compliance and reporting.</span> The analysed information better informs your work. And the data allows the organisation to make smarter data-driven strategic decisions.</li>
</ul>
