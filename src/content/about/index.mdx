The Central Operations Platform (COP) turns traditional manual systems into accessible digital services.

It allows you to easily input information on a mobile-friendly platform. This data is easily accessible, helping better inform your work and that of your organisation.

COP aims to reduce Border Forceâ€™s dependence on old applications, particularly those based on Microsoft Excel and Access, capturing and sharing information consistently, quickly and more accurately using a modern cloud-based workflow platform.

Watch to find out more about how COP is transforming the way Border Force collects and shares data.
