Provision of the Central Operations Platform (COP) is from Borders Systems and the Digital, Data and Technology directorate, both of which are part of the Home Office. 

The data controller for COP is Border Force – a data controller determines how and why personal data can be processed. You can request our Data Protection Impact Assessment and Data Management Policy from the COP team. 

This privacy policy applies only to the actions of COP and users of COP. It does not extend to any websites that can be accessed from COP.

<LargeTitle text={'What data we need'} />

The personal data we collect from you on COP may include:

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>your full name</li>
  <li>your job role and team</li>
  <li>your Adelphi number</li>
  <li>your mandatory declaration</li>
  <li>your security clearance levels and expiry date</li>
  <li>your Internet Protocol (IP) address, and details of which version of web browser and device that you used</li>
  <li>information on how you use the site, using cookies and page tagging techniques:</li>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>the pages you visit on cop.homeoffice.gov.uk</li>
    <li>how long you spend on each cop.homeoffice.gov.uk page</li>
    <li>what you click on while you’re visiting the site</li>
    </ul>
  <li>your POISE ID</li>
  <li>your Home Office email address</li>
 <li>your mobile phone number</li>
  <li>pages that you view</li>
</ul>

Under the Data Protection Act 2018, we are processing this information on a performance-of-a-public-task basis to allow you to conduct your duties as a Border Force employee. We are also reliant on contractual processing of your data.

All information added to the platform is linked to your unique user ID for audit purposes

<LargeTitle text={'Cookies'} />

COP uses cookies and you cannot access COP from a non-Home Office device. Cookies allow COP administrators to understand how the platform is used, in order to improve the service—for example identifying the time period when the service is used least so that updates to it can be pushed out at these times; or streamlining how pages are accessed based on how users click through the site. By continuing to use the service, you are agreeing to the use of cookies and similar technologies for the purposes described in the policy. At the time of writing, all cookies used by COP are essential to the use of the service and you cannot opt out of them.

COP uses both persistent and session Matomo cookies. The two types of persistent cookies are:

<BulletList list={['_pk_id: used to store a few details about you such as the unique visitor ID, stored for 13 months; and', '_pk_ref: used to store information to initially identify you when you visit the website, stored for 6 months.']} />

The two types of session cookies are:

<BulletList list={['_pk_hsr (heatmap and session recording); and', '_pk_ses: used to temporarily store data for the visit and are stored for 30 minutes.']} />

A user can remove cookies by deleting them from the browser. This can be done by clicking Ctrl+H and navigating to the option to clear history, of which cookies can usually be found as a subset.

<LargeTitle text={'Why we need this data'} />

We use cookie information to enable you to log into the service that we provide and to link information you add into COP to your account.

We use the information you provide to help ensure that we can enforce access control and keep data secure.

We use information about your email and your name that we hold within the system when we send you a notification. We use the GOV.UK Notify service, to send you notifications from COP to your Home Office email address; this service is operated and assured by the Cabinet Office.

The legal basis for processing your personal data is for the performance of a public task and under contract. Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations (PECR) require either the subscriber’s or the user’s consent. In the case that the employer is the subscriber and the employee the user, consent from the employer is reasonable if the use of the service is necessary for the employee to fulfil their duties.

We use a service called Matomo to collect information about how you use the COP. We do this to help make sure that the site is meeting the needs of its users and help us to make improvements to the site and service that we provide.

<LargeTitle text={'What we do with your data'} />

The data we collect may be shared with supplier organisations, other government departments, agencies and public bodies, but only when there is an appropriate Border Force business need that will be facilitated by sharing this data. For example, we will share some information with Home Office Performance and Reporting Analytics Unit (PRAU) for MI Reporting.

We will not:

<BulletList list={['sell or rent your data to third parties', 'share your data with third parties for marketing purposes']} />

We will share your data if we are required to do so by law—for example, by court order—or to prevent fraud or other crime.

Information captured via cookies within Matomo includes a unique visitor ID, information to initially identify a user when a website is visited, analytical information and session data temporarily stored for the visit.

<LargeTitle text={'How long we keep your data'} />

We will only retain your personal data for as long as:

<BulletList list={['it is needed for the purposes set out in this document', 'the law requires us to']} />

In general, this means that we will only hold your personal data for the time you are a member of Border Force and then for a maximum of 5 years after you leave the Force.

<LargeTitle text={'Where your data is processed and stored'} />

We design, build and run our systems to make sure that your data is as safe as possible while it is being processed or stored. We store your data on an assured platform within the UK.

We use GOV.UK Notify, a service provided by Cabinet Office to send you notifications about the COP. Any information included in the notification email or SMS is stored in Notify for a maximum of 7 days; this is stored within the European Economic Area (EEA).

<LargeTitle text={'How we protect your data and keep it secure'} />

We are committed to doing all that we can to keep your data secure. We have set up systems and processes to prevent unauthorised access or disclosure of your data — for example, we protect your data using varying levels of encryption.

We also make sure that any third parties that we deal with keep all personal data they process on our behalf secure.

<LargeTitle text={'What are your rights?'} />

You have the right to request:

<BulletList list={['information about how your personal data is processed', 'a copy of that personal data — this copy will be provided in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format','that anything inaccurate in your personal data is corrected immediately']} />

You can also:

<BulletList list={['raise an objection about how your personal data is processed', 'request that your personal data is erased if there is no longer a justification for it', 'ask that the processing of your personal data is restricted in certain circumstances']} />

If you have any of these requests get in contact with the COP team, by raising a support request at the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://support.cop.homeoffice.gov.uk/servicedesk/customer/portal/3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Service Desk</a>

<p class="govuk-body">If you are unsatisfied with how we respond to your request please escalate this to the Office of the Data Protection Officer within the Home Office, either through the forms on Horizon or by emailing <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:dpo@homeoffice.gov.uk">dpo@homeoffice.gov.uk.</a></p>

<LargeTitle text={'Changes to this notice'} />

We may modify or amend this privacy notice at our discretion at any time. When we make changes to this notice, we will amend the last modified date at the top of this page. Any modification or amendment to this privacy notice will be applied to you and your data as of that revision date. We encourage you to periodically review this privacy notice to be informed about how we are protecting your data.
