Watch the short video <a href="#" class="govuk-link" target="_blank">here</a> to see how to use the Command Brief to filter and view Border Events.

To change the date range either drag the circles or click on and select specific start and end dates.

Filter the Border Events by selecting the Branch (Region), Location and/or mode of transport.

The main panel on the left shows all the Border Events submitted up to the last 30 minutes.

The smaller panels on the right show <u>for your selected list</u> of Border Events:

a. the last 5 Border Events where Items were detected;<br />
b. the last 5 Border Events where a Person was intercepted.

To open a Border Event listed in the main panel select the ‘COP url’ link on the left, the Border Event can be viewed in the **‘Cases’** part of COP, this will open in a new window.

To view the Border Event follow the process shown below to open the multi-part Border Event – **Note you will not submit a new Border Event and the data displayed cannot be changed.**
