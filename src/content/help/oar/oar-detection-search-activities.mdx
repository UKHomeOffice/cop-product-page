<MediumTitle text={'Detection/search activities'} />

To understand what detection/search activities to choose, look at the activity guidance.

If the same detection/search activity is used several times with different ‘target types’, record each instance individually.

**For example;** if some staff use Self Selection during RoRo vehicle searches and others use scanners, record them separately.

<SmallTitle text={'Positive and negative exams'} />

'Target types’ are recorded as either positive or negative exams:

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
	<li><strong>A positive exam</strong> means goods or persons of interest detected during a search</li>
	<li><strong>A negative exam</strong> means nothing detected during a search. Note; you can give an estimate if you don't know the exact number of searches that resulted in no detections during the shift.</li>
</ul>
