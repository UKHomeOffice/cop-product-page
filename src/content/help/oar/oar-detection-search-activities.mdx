<p class="govuk-body">To understand what detection/search activities to choose, <Link to="/help/oar/oar-understanding-activity-categories#oarTables" class="govuk-link">look at the activity guidance.</Link></p>

If the same detection/search activity is used several times with different ‘target types’, record each instance individually. For example, if some staff use Self Selection during RoRo vehicle searches and others use scanners, record them separately.

<SmallTitle text={'Positive and negative exams'} />

'Target types’ are recorded as either positive or negative exams:

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
	<li><strong>A positive exam</strong> means goods or persons of interest detected during a search</li>
	<li><strong>A negative exam</strong> means nothing detected during a search. You can give an estimate if you don't know the exact number of searches that resulted in no detections during the shift.</li>
</ul>
