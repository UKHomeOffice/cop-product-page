The OAR allows teams to submit details of their shift daily.

It’s a **mandatory requirement**, which needs to be completed at the end of each shift —100% completion rate covering all staff is expected.

Data from the OAR submissions allow Border Force to plan, operate more efficiently and protect the border better.

The Operational Activity Reporting (OAR) replaced the old End of Shift Reporting (EOSR). It’s designed to reduce the time needed to record shift activities
