<MediumTitle text={'Enter time and shift details'} />

Make sure the time and date at the top of the form match the date and time your team’s shift started.

<SmallTitle text={'Team split between locations'} />

If some team members are on detached duty in a different location, their host team should record their activities.

If that isn’t possible, you can create a separate report for those team members with the location they are at.

<SmallTitle text={'Calculating total hours'} />

Calculate the total number of hours and minutes staff from each grade worked. excluding meal breaks. 

For example: 

<BulletList list={['Ten higher officers on the shift work 7 hours and 20 minutes each', 'So 10 x 7 hours 20 minutes = 73 hours and 20 minutes.']} />

Repeat the process for the staff from other grades.

**Note,** don’t enter decimals (like in the old EOSR) — so it’s 7 hours 20 minutes, not 7.4 hours.
