<MediumTitle text={'Entering time and shift details'} />

Make sure the time and date at the top of the form match the date and time your team’s shift started.

<SmallTitle text={'Team split between locations'} />

If some team members are on detached duty in a different location, their host team should record their activities.

If that isn’t possible, you can create a separate report for those team members with the location they are at.

<SmallTitle text={'Calculating total hours'} />

For each grade, calculate the total number of hours and minutes the team worked excluding, meal breaks. For example:
If you had 10 higher officers on the shift, each working 7 hours and 20 minutes, the total time is 73 hours and 20 minutes.
Repeat the process for other staff on your shift from different grades.

**N.B** don’t enter decimals (like in the old EOSR); so it’s 7 hours 20 minutes, not 7.4 hours.
