Make sure you fill in the OAR at the end of your team’s shift.

Ensure you have all the details you need for that shift as you cannot save your progress. **You need to complete the form in one session.**

Take a minute to read the guidance at the start of the form, especially if it’s the first time you’re submitting an OAR.
