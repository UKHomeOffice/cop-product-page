Make sure the time and date at the top of the form match the date and make sure you fill in the OAR at the end of your team’s shift.

Ensure you have all the details you need for that shift as you cannot save your progress and will have to complete the form in one go.

Take a minute to read the guidance at the start of the form, especially if it’s the first time you’re submitting an OAR.
