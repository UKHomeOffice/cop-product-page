Intelligence Workflow is a centralised system for BFID to record the end to end process from referral to enhancing the information. It will replace all BFID siloed case management spreadsheets / databases and processes.

Intelligence workflow will be used for the following:

<BulletList list={['Enhancing Events at the Border and Intelligence referrals', 'Self-generating and enhancing information', 'Recording and enhancing an external agency referral']} />

<MediumTitle text={'End to end process'}/>

<MediumTitle text={'Intel Flows'}/>

<BulletList list={['All IENs and frontline referrals with be triaged by BFNIH', 'All self-generated referrals will be triaged by the originating team', 'External agency referrals will be generated by BFNIH / MAH', 'Teams receiving the referrals can assign primacy to another team and reallocate to them for enhancement']} />

<MediumTitle text={'Operating procedures'}/>

Information that has been triaged and assessed and deemed to require further attention from a Border Force Intelligence Officer will be processed via the Standard Operating Procedures, which will be accessible from <a class="govuk-link" href="https://horizon.homeoffice.gov.uk/apps/groups/bfid-cop-intel-workflow-forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">the COP intel workflow page on Horizon.</a>
