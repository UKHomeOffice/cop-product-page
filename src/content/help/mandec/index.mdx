The Mandatory Declarations (Man Dec) allows Border Force to identify potential conflicts of interest, which could make the organisation vulnerable to integrity threats.

All Border Force staff must complete the Man Dec.

It safeguards both you and the organisation and reinforces a culture of professionalism and integrity, which enhances UK border security.

Around 85% of staff members have nothing to declare.

A new declaration is required:

<BulletList list={['annually', 'if youâ€™re a new joiner', 'if any of your circumstances have changed.']} />

<MediumTitle text={'What to consider when completing the form'}/>
