If you’re a line manager, an email will notify you that a staff member’s Man Dec needs reviewing.

You can see under ‘tasks assigned to you’ in your dashboard who’s submitted a Man Dec for you to review.

If the submission is incomplete, you can reject the Man Dec and outline what your staff needs to do to complete the form successfully.

<MediumTitle text={'Integrity Lead'}/>

Refer queries to your integrity lead if you need further guidance on something.

When the integrity lead responds, you’ll get an email and be able to view the response in your task list.

If the Integrity Lead rejects your review, you’ll have to re-complete the review with the Integrity Lead’s guidance. This could mean rejecting the Man Dec from your staff and asking them to provide more details.

<MediumTitle text={'Checking report completion'}/>

Having approved a staff declaration, you can see the date of when the Man Dec was completed in “Reports.” You can also see who amongst your staff has completed the form, or not.
