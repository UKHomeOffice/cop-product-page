To fill in your Man Dec, you’ll need to add your line manager first.
You can do this at the start of the Man Dec process or by going to “Edit Profile”

Once you’ve added your line manager, you need to wait for their approval before you can begin submitting your Man Dec form.

Once approved, you’ll see a task has been assigned to you on the ‘Operational Dashboard’. Go into the task and begin filling in your Man Dec form.
