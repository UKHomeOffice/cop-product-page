To fill in the Man Dec, you’ll need to add your line manager first:

<BulletList list={['You can do this at the start of the Man Dec process', 'or by clicking “My Profile” on the top right-hand corner of the navigation.']} />

**Your line manager needs to approve the request before you can begin submitting your Man Dec form.**

Once your line manager has approved, you’ll get an email confirmation. You can then go into ‘Forms’ and begin your Man Dec.
