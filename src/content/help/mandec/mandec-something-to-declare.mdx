If you have a ‘positive declaration’ to make, you first need to record your security clearance details and answer a series of ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ questions on the following themes; sponsorship, other employment, criminality, personal finance and business interests.

A new ‘task’ will appear on your dashboard once you’ve submitted those details. You can now add more details about your positive declarations on each theme.
