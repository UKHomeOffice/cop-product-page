If you have a ‘positive declaration’ to make, you first need to record your security clearance details and answer a series of ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ questions on the following themes:

<BulletList list={['Sponsorship', 'Other employment', 'Criminality', 'Personal finance', 'Business interests']} />

Once you’ve submitted those details, a new ‘task’ will appear on your dashboard. You can now add more details about your positive declarations for anything you’ve said ‘yes’ to.

**You need to complete the form in one go. You cannot save your progress, so make sure you have all the details you need to complete the form from the start.**

Watch this quick run-through to see the steps you need to take to complete the form:

<Video source={'https://training.cop.homeoffice.gov.uk/videos/ManDec-positive-sub.mp4'} width={487} height={64}/>

<BreakLine pixels={'30'} />

If your Man Dec gets rejected by your line manager, you’ll get a task notifying you what you need to do to complete it successfully.

<p>For clarification or guidance about anything on the form, you can email the
