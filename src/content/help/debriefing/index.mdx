<MediumTitle text={'Debriefing Overview'}/>

Debriefing is an evaluation process carried out by personnel following operational activity, incidents, events or training. Debriefing assists individuals, teams and/or groups to consider, analyse and evaluate what happened.

Opportunities to review activity will occur following incidents or events and it is essential that debriefs are undertaken at the first available opportunity following these events.

The resulting lessons learned or best practice can be used to improve, amend or review existing policies / procedures and help inform planning.

Debriefing is not about apportioning blame. The aim is to provide a constructive, supportive and confidential environment, encouraging team leaders and staff to review thought processes and decisions made during operational activity.
