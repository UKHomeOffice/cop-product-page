A debrief is not required every shift. You should complete a debrief during or as soon after operational activity when one of the following is identified:

<BulletList list={['Sharing best practice – to let others know that something worked well, particularly if they might benefit from this information.' ,'Lessons learned – if something goes wrong what could be done differently next time? How might others learn from this?', 'Issues with policy or procedure – perhaps a process needs refining and could be made more efficient.', 'Health & safety / welfare concerns – accidents should be reported in the normal way but near misses or welfare concerns can be raised via debriefing.', 'Training needs – does a skills gap or shortage impact on operational delivery?', 'Equipment or infrastructure issues – has a lack of equipment or infrastructure issue prevented you from completing your work?']} />

This is not an exhaustive list, there may be other occasions that would benefit from a debrief.

**Reminder**: Do not record business as usual activity or personal information.
