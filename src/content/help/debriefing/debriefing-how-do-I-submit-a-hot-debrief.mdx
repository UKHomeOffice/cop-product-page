The Hot Debrief can be found under ‘Forms’ on the COP Operational Dashboard.

Line Managers will receive a notification that contains a link to the debrief stored on COP. 

Regional Assurance teams will review all debriefs and distribute information to relevant stakeholders for action as appropriate e.g. Operational Logistics H&S Team / OAD. They will also produce statistical data for regional management teams.

You should resolve any queries raised via the COP if you are able to do so. Time critical issues or risks should be escalated to Senior Managers as appropriate - the Hot Debrief does not replace established reporting structures and processes. 

The member of staff who raised the debrief should be kept informed of progress.
