You must report all events where you have used force against a person. When completing the form consider the following:

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
	<li>if you’re unsure about what constitutes ‘force’, consult the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://horizon.fcos.gsi.gov.uk/file-wrapper/use-force-and-reporting" target="blank" rel="noreferrer">‘Use of force and reporting guidance'.</a> You can also find a summary of the guidance at the start of the form.</li>
	<li>submit a form even if you’re in doubt about whether to fill in the form or not.</li>
</ul>

Remember to complete the form every time you use handcuffs, (including compliant handcuffing), complaint escort position and when you have used tactical communications for fingerprinting and search of person (only if a person initially refuses but becomes compliant after tactical communications are used).

If you are unsure about any part of this form, consult your line manager or duty manager.
