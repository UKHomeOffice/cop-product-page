You must report all incidents of where you have used force against a person. When completing the form consider the following:

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
	<li>if you’re unsure about what constitutes ‘force’, consult the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://horizon.fcos.gsi.gov.uk/file-wrapper/use-force-and-reporting" target="blank" rel="noreferrer">‘Use of force and reporting guidance'.</a> You can also find a summary of the guidance at the start of the form.</li>
	<li>submit a form even if you’re in doubt about whether to fill in the form or not.  Documenting any incident gives you protection if any complaints arise.</li>
    <li>complete the form every time you use handcuffs. The overwhelming majority of the forms completed are related to the use of handcuffs</li>
</ul>

If you’re still unsure about anything, consult your line manager.
