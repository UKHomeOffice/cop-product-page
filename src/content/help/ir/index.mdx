The Intelligence Referral is a new product that allows Border Force staff to make Border Force Intelligence aware of information that may become intelligence.

Depending on your system access, the Intelligence Referral form can be used to:

<BulletList list={['refer information from the frontline to Border Force National Intelligence Hub', 'self generate intelligence at the Regional Intelligence Units', 'generate external intelligence referrals at the border Force National Intelligence Hub']} />

The Intelligence Referral form does not replace any existing HUMINT processes and these should continue to be adhered to.
