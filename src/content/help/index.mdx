You will need to create an account on COP before you can access the various services and forms (such as Man Dec and OAR).

You can do this with your POISE Active Directory (AD) account.

**Note,** laptops/desktops need Windows 10 and an up-to-date Microsoft Edge browser.

**1.** &nbsp;<a class="govuk-link" href={COPSite} target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Go to COP</a> and sign in using the **‘POISE’** button.

You should sign in to COP automatically if your laptop/desktop is already logged into POISE. If on a mobile, you’ll need to enter your POISE username and password again when prompted.
