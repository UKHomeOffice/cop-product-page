The Events at the Border form is a new product that has been developed to replace the need for an officer to complete an Immediate Event Notification, Cash Detection or National Security Referral form.

Events at the Border is intended to be the "Single Referral Mechanism" that officers have been requesting for a while.

<MediumTitle text={'When should an Event at the Border form be completed?'}/>

An Event at the Border form should be completed when:

<BulletList list={['there has been an interdiction at the border that has had a positive outcome such as a seizure', 'there has been an interdiction at the border that has had a negative outcome such as a target which resulted in a no-show']} />

<MediumTitle text={'What has changed'}/>

Officers no longer need to concern themselves with the "diminimus limits" imposed on them by the old reporting process. 
Events at the Border has business logic built into it and will alert the relevant stakeholders to the event upon submission of the form, based on what the user has reported.

This means that users no longer need to complete the pre-existing Immediate Event Notification form, National Security Referral form or Cash Detection form as these are all combined into a single Event at the Border form.
