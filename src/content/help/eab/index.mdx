The Events at the Border form is a new product that has been developed to replace the need for an officer to complete an Immediate Event Notification, Cash Detection or National Security Referral form.

Events at the Border is intended to be the "Single Referral Mechanism" that officers have been requesting for a while.

An Event at the Border form should be completed when:

<BulletList list={['there has been an interdiction at the border that has had a positive outcome such as a seizure', 'there has been an interdiction at the border that has had a negative outcome such as a target which resulted in a no-show']} />

Officers no longer need to concern themselves with the "diminimus limits" imposed on them by the old Immediate Event Notification form. 

Events at the Border has this business logic built into it and will alert the relevant stakeholders to the event upon submission of the form, based on what the user has included in their submission.
