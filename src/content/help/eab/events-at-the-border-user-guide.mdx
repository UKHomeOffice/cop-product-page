Border Force is aspiring to become a data driven organisation. We can usethe data captured during interactions at the UK Border to inform many other business processes from intelligence and targeting to port vulnerability and operational deployments and the Central Operations Platform has changed the way we move this information around the business.

Completing the Events at the Border form on the Central Operations Platform enables this to happen. Once the form is submitted the data is delivered to whichever parts of the business have a need for it. Historically, this was why there were multiple forms an officer would need to complete for a single event; each area of the business had its own formfor its own purposes.

Users are instructed to complete the form as fully as possible. Although this may, upon immediate review seem time consuming, the details you 
input will, as an example, provide Intelligence and Targeting with more meaningful and better quality information, inform better debriefs and improve future targets. Additionally, Events at the Border will link into other Border Force systems, therefore reducing the need to double-key. Keep an eye on the <Link class="govuk-link" to="/about/roadmap">COP Roadmap</Link> for details of which systems we are looking to integrate with, and when.
