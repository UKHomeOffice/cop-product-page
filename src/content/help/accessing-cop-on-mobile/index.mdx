The COP icon has now been rolled out to all Border Force Apple (IOS) and Android mobile devices.

<img src={'/images/help/accessing-mobile/cop-icon.png'} alt={'cop icon'} style={{maxWidth: '90px', maxHeight: '90px' }} />

<BreakLine pixels={20} />

This means that Officers can access COP to complete OARs, Covid-19 Compliance Checks, Mandatory Declarations, Record Border Events, Intelligence Referrals etc..

To activate download of the icon you usually just need to turn your mobile device on.  

**If the COP icon does not appear straight away then follow the following procedure:**

<ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
  <li>Please update your mobile device to the latest version to ensure that the latest date software and security patches are in place – <strong>please contact IT Now if you have any questions about how to do this.</strong></li>
  <li>Connect using the ‘Hub’ app on your Poise mobile device.</li>

The Hub app looks like this:

<img src={'/images/help/accessing-mobile/hub-icon.png'} alt={'hub icon'} style={{maxWidth: '90px', maxHeight: '90px' }} />

<BreakLine pixels={20} />

<li>If you have an Apple device: &nbsp; &nbsp; Select Hub app > <strong>This device</strong> > Send Data..</li>
<li>If you have an Android device: &nbsp; &nbsp; Select Hub app > <strong>Profiles</strong> > COP.</li>
</ol>
